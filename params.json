Cool!\r\n\r\nSoooo... this is the start of a much larger idea for json based generative osc interfaces. That being said I would really like to develop this code to be modular, allowing for parts to be taken from it to be used in other projects.  To accomplish this I will most likely use Fluid Infusion.\r\n\r\nThings are going to be super rough for now... I am primarily building this as a test for a school project, and it is going to look absolutely nothing like what I am envisioning... but I have been iterating around this idea for a while, so it may as well exist as a single package.\r\n\r\nIn its current state the application will serve a responsive canvas based web application.  The web app will track the placement of up to 5 fingers as well as the accelerometer data of a mobile device, send those to node with socket.io, and then send it out over localhost using node-osc.\r\n\r\n###OSC Api\r\n\r\nThe api is pretty simple.  It will send osc messages over local host to port 3333.  The messages you can receive are as follow\r\n\r\n####Finger\r\n/[fingernumber]/state i  ~ state of finger... 1 for on and 0 for off\r\n\r\n/[fingernumber]/position f f ~ x and y co-ordinates of the finger\r\n\r\nfinger number can be \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\r\n\r\n####Tilt\r\n/alpha f ~ value for accelerometer alpha\r\n\r\n/beta f ~ value for accelerometer beta\r\n\r\n/gamma f ~ value for accelerometer gamma\r\n\r\n###Examples\r\nThis project comes with a dsp example written in chuck, it can be found at dsp/chuck/dsp.ck\r\nIf you would like to launch both chuck and the node server at once you can run start.sh\r\n\r\n$ ./start.sh\r\n\r\n###Licensing\r\n\r\nInterface.js is distributed under the terms the MIT or GPL2 Licenses.
