#interface.js

###About

Node, Sockets, OSC, Inclusive Design, Code Generation...  Cool!

Soooo... this is the start of a much larger idea for json based generative osc interfaces. That being said I would really like to develop this code to be modular, allowing for parts to be taken from it to be used in other projects.  To accomplish this I will most likely use Fluid Infusion.

Things are going to be super rough for now... I am primarily building this as a test for a school project, and it is going to look absolutely nothing like what I am envisioning... but I have been iterating around this idea for a while, so it may as well exist as a single package.
