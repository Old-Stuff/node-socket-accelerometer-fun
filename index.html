<h3>About</h3>

<p>Node, Sockets, OSC, Inclusive Design, Code Generation...  Cool!</p>

<p>Soooo... this is the start of a much larger idea for json based generative osc interfaces. That being said I would really like to develop this code to be modular, allowing for parts to be taken from it to be used in other projects.  To accomplish this I will most likely use Fluid Infusion.</p>

<p>Things are going to be super rough for now... I am primarily building this as a test for a school project, and it is going to look absolutely nothing like what I am envisioning... but I have been iterating around this idea for a while, so it may as well exist as a single package.</p>

<p>In its current state the application will serve a responsive canvas based web application.  The web app will track the placement of up to 5 fingers as well as the accelerometer data of a mobile device, send those to node with socket.io, and then send it out over localhost using node-osc.</p>

<h3>OSC Api</h3>

<p>The api is pretty simple.  It will send osc messages over local host to port 3333.  The messages you can receive are as follow</p>

<h4>Finger</h4>

<p>/[fingernumber]/state i  ~ state of finger... 1 for on and 0 for off
/[fingernumber]/position f f ~ x and y co-ordinates of the finger</p>

<p>finger number can be "one", "two", "three", "four", "five</p>

<h4>Tilt</h4>

<p>/alpha f ~ value for accelerometer alpha
/beta f ~ value for accelerometer beta
/gamma f ~ value for accelerometer gamma</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>This project comes with a dsp example written in chuck, it can be found at dsp/chuck/dsp.ck
If you would like to launch both chuck and the node server at once you can run start.sh</p>

<p>$ ./start.sh</p>
